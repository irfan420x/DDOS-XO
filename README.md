### 🌟 "I am LUNA. I don't just follow commands; I understand you."

</div>

## 🚀 Overview
**LUNA-ULTRA** is not just another AI assistant. It is a highly advanced, autonomous digital twin designed to live on your desktop. Powered by **DeepSeek**, LUNA understands your emotions, sees your screen, writes and tests code, and manages your system with unprecedented autonomy.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 🎭 Emotional Intelligence
LUNA uses your camera to detect your facial expressions. If you're frustrated with a bug, LUNA will offer encouragement and proactive solutions.

### 👁️ Visual Awareness
- **On-Demand Vision**: "Luna, look at my screen." LUNA captures your screen to help debug code or explain what you're seeing.
- **OCR Integration**: Reads text from images and videos in real-time.

### 💻 Autonomous Execution
- **Self-Healing Code**: LUNA writes code, runs it in a sandbox, and fixes errors automatically until it works.
- **GitHub Integration**: LUNA can commit and push your projects directly to your repositories.

### 🌐 Multilingual Mastery
Fluent in **Bengali** and **English**. LUNA understands the nuances of your language and culture.

### 🕒 3-Day Rolling Memory
LUNA remembers every conversation and task from the last 3 days, providing perfect context for your ongoing projects.
