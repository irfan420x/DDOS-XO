# 🚀 DDOS-XO: The "Architect-X" Evolution

This roadmap defines the transition of DDOS-XO into a proactive system guardian and autonomous developer.

---

## 1. 🛡️ Proactive Security Sentinel
LUNA will move beyond just "monitoring" to "protecting":
- **Live Port Sentry**: LUNA will continuously monitor open ports. If a new, unauthorized port opens (like a backdoor), LUNA will immediately alert you via Telegram and ask to close it.
- **Log Analysis**: It will scan `/var/log/auth.log` (on Kali) or Event Viewer (on Windows) for brute-force attacks and automatically suggest IP blocking.

## 2. 🛠️ Autonomous Project Debugger (Self-Healing)
LUNA's code agent will be upgraded to handle **multi-file errors**:
- **Cross-File Reasoning**: If a change in `main.py` breaks `utils.py`, LUNA will trace the error across both files and fix the root cause.
- **Auto-Test Suite**: For every project LUNA builds, it will automatically write and run unit tests to ensure 100% functionality before showing it to you.

## 🎙️ Visual Voice Sync (Emotion GUI)
Making LUNA feel more "alive":
- **Voice Waveforms**: The GUI will feature a live audio visualizer that moves in sync with LUNA's voice.
- **Status Icons**: LUNA's "avatar" in the GUI will change based on its state (e.g., a "Thinking" brain icon, a "Shield" icon for security tasks, or a "Code" icon for development).

## 📱 Telegram 2.0 (The Remote Dashboard)
Your phone becomes a full control center:
- **File Manager**: Send a command to LUNA to "Upload project to GitHub" or "Send me the latest log file" directly through Telegram.
- **Live Charts**: LUNA can send you images of system resource charts (CPU/RAM usage) so you can monitor your PC's health visually from your phone.

> **The Vision**: DDOS-XO is no longer just an agent you use; it is a **Guardian** that watches your back and an **Engineer** that builds your future.
